# Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC): Core Framework

Status: Exploratory theoretical framework  
Scope: Functional and dynamical properties of embodied systems  
Non-scope: Subjective experience, phenomenology, metaphysics of consciousness

This document summarizes the minimal architectural assumptions and axioms
underlying the simulations in this repository.

Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC) defines conscious coherence as an
operational dynamical property that can be tested through perturbation
and recovery, independent of substrate or implementation.

## 1. Core Definitions

### Definition 1 — Stream
A stream is a semi-autonomous dynamical subprocess that updates over time
based on:
- internal state or memory
- inputs (environmental or internal)
- local update rules
- coupling to other streams

Streams do not need to correspond to biological modules or semantic units.

---

### Definition 2 — Environment
The environment is any external dynamical process that:
- evolves independently of the system
- can be perturbed
- causally interacts with the system

The environment is treated as co-dynamical, not as a static input source.

---

### Definition 3 — Binding
Binding is a form of dynamical integration in which multiple streams jointly
determine the system's global state.

A system is considered bound if the global state cannot be decomposed into
independent stream dynamics, and perturbations to one stream propagate
non-trivially to others.

---

### Definition 4 — Embodied Coupling
A system exhibits embodied coupling if:
1. The environment causally influences internal streams
2. Internal streams causally influence the environment
3. Removing or freezing this coupling measurably alters internal dynamics

Embodiment is defined relationally, not anatomically.

---

### Definition 5 — Counterfactual Perturbation
A counterfactual perturbation is a sudden, unexpected change applied to the
system or environment that cannot be absorbed by trivial continuation or
simple error minimization.

---

### Definition 6 — Counterfactual Sensitivity
A system exhibits counterfactual sensitivity if a perturbation produces:
- a structured internal deviation, followed by
- non-trivial reorganization rather than collapse or runaway instability

This excludes frozen, purely reactive, or explosively unstable systems.

---

### Definition 7 — Regulated Recovery
Regulated recovery occurs when, after perturbation, the system returns
toward a viable dynamical regime:
- without freezing
- without collapsing internal structure
- without amplifying noise into instability

Recovery is evaluated dynamically, not by endpoint performance.

---

## 2. Axioms of Embodied Conscious Coherence

### Axiom 1 — Multiplicity
A coherent system must contain multiple distinct streams.
Single-stream systems may be reactive or predictive, but not coherent.

---

### Axiom 2 — Binding
Streams must be dynamically bound into a global state.
Mere coexistence or correlation is insufficient.

---

### Axiom 3 — Embodied Dependence
Coherence must depend on ongoing bidirectional coupling with an environment.
If coherence remains unchanged when environmental interaction is removed,
the system is not embodied.

---

### Axiom 4 — Counterfactual Sensitivity
A bound, embodied system must respond proportionally to perturbations.
- Too little response leads to inert or frozen behavior
- Too much response leads to brittle or chaotic behavior

---

### Axiom 5 — Regulated Recovery
After perturbation, the system must reorganize without collapsing,
freezing, or entering runaway instability.

Conscious coherence lies between rigidity and chaos.

---

### Axiom 6 — Symbolic Stabilization
Discrete categorical processes may act as stabilizing constraints on
continuous internal dynamics.

Symbolic or categorical streams are not required for basic reactivity,
but they regulate recovery by bounding sensitivity to perturbation,
reducing noise amplification, and enabling persistent coherence.

In this repository, symbolic stabilization is explored using minimal,
non-semantic categorization mechanisms that feed back as negative control
signals.

---

## 3. Negative Criteria (What Is Insufficient)

The following properties alone are not sufficient for embodied conscious
coherence:
- Low prediction error (can be achieved by freezing; the "dark room" problem)
- High correlation (can arise from shared input or synchronization)
- High entropy (may reflect noise or randomness)
- Fast recovery (may indicate collapse to a trivial attractor)
- Large scale or rich output behavior (may mask brittle dynamics)

---

## 4. Operational Criterion (Minimal Test)

A system exhibits Embodied Conscious Coherence if and only if:
1. It contains two or more streams
2. Streams are dynamically bound
3. It is bidirectionally coupled with an environment
4. Perturbations produce structured deviation followed by regulated recovery
5. Removing binding or embodiment destroys regulated recovery
6. Introducing symbolic categorization stabilizes recovery

This criterion is algorithm- and substrate-independent.

---

## 5. Status Note

This framework is exploratory and subject to revision.
It is intended to guide simulation design and falsifiable testing,
not to serve as a complete or final theory.
