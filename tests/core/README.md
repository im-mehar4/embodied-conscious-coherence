Core exploratory simulations for Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC).

# Test Suite Overview

This directory contains exploratory simulations probing specific
axioms and predictions of the Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC) framework.

All tests are qualitative and intended to discriminate dynamical regimes,
not to establish empirical or neuroscientific claims.

## Core Tests (Phase 1)

Test 1: Reactive vs Symbolic Control  
- Probes: Axiom 6 (Symbolic Stabilization), Axiom 5 (Regulated Recovery)

Test 2: Structural Integrity and Binding  
- Probes: Axiom 4 (Counterfactual Sensitivity), Prediction 1

Test 3: Dark Room Viability  
- Probes: Axiom 3 (Embodied Dependence)

Test 4: Post-Perturbation Response Complexity  
- Probes: Axiom 4 (Regime discrimination via LZ-style proxy)

## Deferred Tests

Additional tests (e.g., deafferentation, input severing) are under development and excluded pending clearer operational definitions.
