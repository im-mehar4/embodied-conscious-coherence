Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC) is an exploratory research framework
investigating how artificial agents maintain stable, coherent behavior when
embedded in dynamic environments.

ECC approaches coherence as a problem of dynamical regulation, rather than
intelligence, language, or subjective experience. The framework focuses on
architectural constraints such as embodiment, stream binding, perturbation
response, and regulated recovery.

This repository does not claim to create conscious or sentient artificial
systems. It provides exploratory tools and simulations for studying robustness
and stability in embodied agent architectures.

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory research prototype investigating
*Embodied Conscious Coherence (ECC)* — a control-theoretic framework for studying
how artificial agents maintain stable, coherent behavior when embedded in
dynamic environments.

The project focuses on functional and dynamical properties of systems rather
than subjective experience or biological realism.

## Important Disclaimer
This work does **not** claim to create conscious, sentient, or subjective
artificial intelligence.

It is a theoretical and computational modeling effort exploring how specific
architectural constraints (e.g., embodiment, binding, and stabilization)
influence agent robustness under perturbation.

## Conceptual Motivation
The central hypothesis explored here is that robust agency requires a system to:
- integrate multiple interacting processes,
- remain coupled to an external environment,
- and regulate internal dynamics to avoid collapse or runaway instability.

ECC frames these requirements using concepts from control theory and dynamical
systems, inspired by (but not claiming equivalence to) biological cognition.

## Scope of the Repository
This repository currently includes:
- Conceptual definitions and axioms describing ECC
- Prototype simulations exploring stability, perturbation recovery, and
  embodiment
- Comparative tests between reactive and regulated agent architectures

All components are subject to revision and are shared for learning,
experimentation, and discussion.

## Limitations
This project has significant limitations, including:
- Small-scale and low-dimensional simulation environments
- Functional abstractions rather than biologically realistic neural models
- No claims addressing phenomenology or the “hard problem” of consciousness

These limitations are acknowledged explicitly and define directions for future
work.

## Transparency
Parts of the prototype implementation were generated with AI assistance, under author supervision and architectural direction.

## Related Ideas
This work is loosely informed by existing research in:
- Control theory and cybernetics
- Computational neuroscience
- Dynamical systems approaches to cognition

ECC should be understood as an exploratory synthesis rather than a competing or
complete theory.
